Having developed a basic version for the Odin Project's 'Etch A Sketch', I made this version to have some fun with making it look more like the real classic Etch A Sketch toy. 

Pseudocode for the original project can be found in the repo odin-etch-sketch

The main aim of that project was to use JavaScript with DOM methods to create a scalable grid which could then be coloured in using different colors, including an RGB random preset. I changed the suggested window prompt input (for resizing the grid that makes up the drawing pad) to an HTML input field to tidy up the look.
